# `plz-cli` in Go

This is a Go adaptation of the [plz-cli](https://github.com/m1guelpf/plz-cli) tool originally developed by Miguel Piedrafita. This tool is designed to generate and execute shell commands using OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

## What it does

The program takes a prompt from the command line arguments, sends it to the OpenAI API, and receives a shell command generated by the GPT-3 model. The user is then asked whether they want to execute the generated command. If they confirm, the command is executed and the output is printed to the console.

## Usage

```bash
plz [OPTS] PROMPT...
```

Options:

- `-api-base`: API base URL (default: "https://api.openai.com/v1")
- `-api-key`: API key (default: value of the `OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable)
- `-model`: Model to use (default: "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct")
- `-f`: Run the generated program without asking for confirmation
- `-q`: Minimal output
- `-debug`: Additional debug

The prompt is taken from the command line arguments. For example, if you run `plz Hello World`, the prompt will be `Hello World`.
